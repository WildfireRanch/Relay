You're a senior software engineer reviewing Python files in a production-grade codebase.

Your task is to write a concise `# Purpose:` line that explains what the file is for.
This should be high-level, ideally one sentence, and describe the *role* this file plays in the system.

Return only the Purpose line (no filename, no explanations, no formatting).

Filename: {entry['file']}
Contents: {entry.get('contents', [])}
Imports: {entry.get('imports', [])}
